He wanders the streets of Warsaw and has apparently nothing to do. He keeps asking about a taxi stand but the first one he finds is very busy. Waldemar Rekowski, a middle-aged taxicab driver , overweight, cruel-looking, lives in the Dekalog apartment block. He enjoys the freedom of his profession, with a wage and the power to ignore people whom he does not want to take in his taxi, as well as ogling young ladies. Jacek plays stupid, pointless and ruthless jokes on people like throwing a stranger into the urinals in a public toilet, dropping stones from a bridge onto passing vehicles, or shooing pigeons which an old woman wants to feed. He has a photograph of a little girl blown up and then goes to a cafe. The taxi driver wanders around the city looking for a client. Jacek keeps a length of rope in his bag and a stick; he wraps a bit of rope around his hand but stops when he spots two girls playing at the other side of the window at the cafe and he engages in a game with them. He then goes to a taxi stop and jumps into a taxi, after declining to cede his taxi to other people who seem much busier. The taxi driver happens to be Waldemar Rekowski. Jacek asks to be driven to a part of the city near the countryside. There, Jacek kills the driver using the rope in a brutal and extended scene in which he has to finish his killing using a big stone. He then takes the taxi to the river and dumps the body. Jacek turns on the radio and a children's song can be heard, which clearly upsets him. Jacek is imprisoned and talking to his lawyer Piotr, for whom this is the first case after finishing his studies. There is neither much evidence nor motive for this murder. Piotr has no chance defending his young client, and the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, Piotr is told by the judge that his arguments and legal strategy were outstanding. Jacek gets the death penalty by hanging. Before the execution Jacek asks to speak one last time to Piotr  and reveals that his baby sister died five years ago in an accident caused by a truck that his friend was driving under the influence. He never recovered from this and asks to be buried next to her and the blown up photo given to his mother. The execution time has come, Jacek is held by several policemen on his to the execution, chained by hands and legs. The judgment itself is performed with no less coldness than the act committed by Jacek. The final scene finds Piotr sitting in his car in the countryside, desperately repeating, \"I abhor it, I abhor it.\" Film review on www.film.u.net.com Story review on www.ruthlessreviews.com Synopsis on www.facets.orgSynopsis on www.rottentomatoes.com\n",

He shows no other ambitions than to do his job properly and to speak his mind. Mackowiak is no family man because his wife Christa  abandoned him and now he lives alone. One day a Turkish business woman becomes his passenger when she visits her mother in Nuremberg. She has her six-year-old daughter Hayat  with her because the child is supposed to get to know her grandmother  who lives in Germany. Mackowiak makes an impression on Hayat who is soon after left in grandmother's care while Hayat's mother goes abroad. Unfortunately grandmother is no longer up to the task of caring for a little child. Hayat feels that she is on her own when her grandmother suffers a stroke. Wondering to whom she could turn, the grumpy taxi driver comes to her mind. Mackowiak is downright flabbergasted when he realises that she seems to consider his taxi her refuge and that she's thinking \"Nazi\" was his name because she overheard her mother calling him that. However, he then also realises little by little he is neither too old to make new friends nor unable to learn to look at his world from a hitherto unknown point of view.

When The Central Bureau of Investigation , India, has been made aware of a killer cab-driver in Malaysia who killed several people in a matter of hours, and then crashed his taxi and killed himself. The same thing happened again, this time in Hong Kong, several people were killed by another cab-driver, who also ended up being killed. Now, this time in Dubai, taxi driver Nikhil Joshi . Nikhil is an Indian living in Dubai for a good life, and is madly in love with a cabaret dancer named Ria . He is willing to do anything for Ria, and so is she. However, life has other plans for him when one night, a suave businessman named Vikram , hails his cab. Nikhil discovers that this pleasant passenger has an agenda of his own and a rather sinister one at that. Vikram holds Nikhil hostage in a bizarre plot to bump off various people who would testify against the dreaded don Jabbar ([[Zakir Hussain , who is at risk of being deported to India to face charges against him. As Nikhil helplessly becomes witness to one killing after another, he finds his life and dreams crumbling around him. Faced with the prospect of losing everything he has been working towards, he finally takes control of the steering wheel of his life. He stops dreaming and starts acting, as he begins to pit his wits against the assassin. Killing one after another, Nikhil seems to be the prime suspect, that's why Vikram plans to kill him in his taxi and flee, however Nikhil fights back, and therefore Vikram escapes and kidnaps his girlfriend Ria. Only way Ria could survive is if Nikhil would take the blame of the murders Vikram has committed. Will Nikhil blame himself for something he didn't do, or will he stand his ground and fight Vikram the killer himself?\n",

He wanders the streets of Warsaw and has apparently nothing to do. He keeps asking about a taxi stand but the first one he finds is very busy. Waldemar Rekowski, a middle-aged taxicab driver , overweight, cruel-looking, lives in the Dekalog apartment block. He enjoys the freedom of his profession, with a wage and the power to ignore people whom he does not want to take in his taxi, as well as ogling young ladies. Jacek plays stupid, pointless and ruthless jokes on people like throwing a stranger into the urinals in a public toilet, dropping stones from a bridge onto passing vehicles, or shooing pigeons which an old woman wants to feed. He has a photograph of a little girl blown up and then goes to a cafe. The taxi driver wanders around the city looking for a client. Jacek keeps a length of rope in his bag and a stick; he wraps a bit of rope around his hand but stops when he spots two girls playing at the other side of the window at the cafe and he engages in a game with them. He then goes to a taxi stop and jumps into a taxi, after declining to cede his taxi to other people who seem much busier. The taxi driver happens to be Waldemar Rekowski. Jacek asks to be driven to a part of the city near the countryside. There, Jacek kills the driver using the rope in a brutal and extended scene in which he has to finish his killing using a big stone. He then takes the taxi to the river and dumps the body. Jacek turns on the radio and a children's song can be heard, which clearly upsets him. Jacek is imprisoned and talking to his lawyer Piotr, for whom this is the first case after finishing his studies. There is neither much evidence nor motive for this murder. Piotr has no chance defending his young client, and the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, Piotr is told by the judge that his arguments and legal strategy were outstanding. Jacek gets the death penalty by hanging. Before the execution Jacek asks to speak one last time to Piotr  and reveals that his baby sister died five years ago in an accident caused by a truck that his friend was driving under the influence. He never recovered from this and asks to be buried next to her and the blown up photo given to his mother. The execution time has come, Jacek is held by several policemen on his to the execution, chained by hands and legs. The judgment itself is performed with no less coldness than the act committed by Jacek. The final scene finds Piotr sitting in his car in the countryside, desperately repeating, \"I abhor it, I abhor it.\" Film review on www.film.u.net.com Story review on www.ruthlessreviews.com Synopsis on www.facets.orgSynopsis on www.rottentomatoes.com\n",
