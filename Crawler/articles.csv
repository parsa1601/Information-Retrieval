Microservices: yesterday today and tomorrow,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,2017,Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state of the art in the field this chapter reviews the history of software architecture the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first and microservices later. Finally open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition we investigate some practical issues and point out a few potential solutions.
A Survey of Man In The Middle Attacks,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC,2016,The Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack is one of the most well known attacks in computer security representing one of the biggest concerns for security professionals. MITM targets the actual data that flows between endpoints and the confidentiality and integrity of the data itself. In this paper we extensively review the literature on MITM to analyse and categorize the scope of MITM attacks considering both a reference model such as the open systems interconnection (OSI) model as well as two specific widely used network technologies i.e. GSM and UMTS. In particular we classify MITM attacks based on several parameters like location of an attacker in the network nature of a communication channel and impersonation techniques. Based on an impersonation techniques classification we then provide execution steps for each MITM class. We survey existing countermeasures and discuss the comparison among …
Foundations and evolution of modern computing paradigms: Cloud iot edge and fog,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC,2019,In the last few years Internet of Things Cloud computing Edge computing and Fog computing have gained a lot of attention in both industry and academia. However a clear and neat definition of these computing paradigms and their correlation is hard to find in the literature. This makes it difficult for researchers new to this area to get a concrete picture of these paradigms. This work tackles this deficiency representing a helpful resource for those who will start next. First we show the evolution of modern computing paradigms and related research interest. Then we address each paradigm neatly delineating its key points and its relation with the others. Thereafter we extensively address Fog computing remarking its outstanding role as the glue between IoT Cloud and Edge computing. In the end we briefly present open challenges and future research directions for IoT Cloud Edge and Fog computing.
Microservices: How to make your application scale,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC,2018,The microservice architecture is a style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity and that promises to change the way in which software is perceived conceived and designed. In this paper we describe the main features of microservices and highlight how these features improve scalability.
A systematic survey of industrial Internet of Things security: Requirements and fog computing opportunities,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC,2020,A key application of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm lies within industrial contexts. Indeed the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) commonly referred to as Industry 4.0 promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices and the combination of emerging computing technologies such as Fog/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field we deem it important to systematically survey the academic …
DDoS-capable IoT malwares: Comparative analysis and Mirai investigation,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC,2018,The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has not only carried the astonishing promise to interconnect a whole generation of traditionally “dumb” devices but also brought to the Internet the menace of billions of badly protected and easily hackable objects. Not surprisingly this sudden flooding of fresh and insecure devices fueled older threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper we first propose an updated and comprehensive taxonomy of DDoS attacks together with a number of examples on how this classification maps to real-world attacks. Then we outline the current situation of DDoS-enabled malwares in IoT networks highlighting how recent data support our concerns about the growing in popularity of these malwares. Finally we give a detailed analysis of the general framework and the operating principles of Mirai the most disruptive DDoS-capable IoT malware seen so far.

Our goal is to assess the applicability of blockchains in the supply chain domain and to provide a foundation for practitioners and researchers to direct their future projects towards improving the …
ODMAC: An on-demand MAC protocol for energy harvesting-wireless sensor networks,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,2011,Energy Harvesting (EH) provides a promising solution to one of the biggest problems faced by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) namely the energy supply. By harvesting energy from the surrounding environment the sensors can have an in finite lifetime without any needs for battery recharge or replacement. Battery-powered WSNs are typically designed to maximize the energy conservation in order to postpone as much as possible the inevitable battery depletion. Instead EH-WSNs are being designed on a different principle. The focus is on maximizing the network performance while operating at a state that is energetically sustainable. In this paper we present ODMAC an on demand MAC protocol for EH-WSNs which is able to support individual duty cycles for nodes with different energy profiles. Hence each node is able to increase its energy consumption thus its performance to the level that the energy …
Microservices: Migration of a mission critical system,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC,2018,An increasing interest is growing around the idea of microservices and the promise of improving scalability when compared to monolithic systems. Several companies are evaluating pros and cons of a complex migration. In particular financial institutions are positioned in a difficult situation due to the economic climate and the appearance of agile competitors that can navigate in a more flexible legal framework and started their business since day one with more agile architectures and without being bounded to outdated technological standard.

Analysis of DDoS-capable IoT malwares,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,2017,The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution promises to make our lives easier by providing cheap and always connected smart embedded devices which can interact on the Internet and create added values for human needs. But all that glitters is not gold. Indeed the other side of the coin is that from a security perspective this IoT revolution represents a potential disaster. This plethora of IoT devices that flooded the market were very badly protected thus an easy prey for several families of malwares that can enslave and incorporate them in very large botnets. This eventually brought back to the top Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks making them more powerful and easier to achieve than ever. This paper aims at provide an up-to-date picture of DDoS attacks in the specific subject of the IoT studying how these attacks work and considering the most common families in the IoT context in terms of their nature …
Security-by-contract: Toward a semantics for digital signatures on mobile code,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2007,In this paper we propose the notion of security-by-contract a mobile contract that an application carries with itself. The key idea of the framework is that a digital signature should not just certify the origin of the code but rather bind together the code with a contract. We provide a description of the overall life-cycle of mobile code in the setting of security-by-contract describe a tentative structure for a contractual language and propose a number of algorithms for one of the key steps in the process the contract-policy matching issue. We argue that security-by-contract would provide a semantics for digital signatures on mobile code thus being a step in the transition from trusted code to trustworthy code.
Receiver-initiated medium access control protocols for wireless sensor networks,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,2015,One of the fundamental building blocks of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that part of the system governing when and how two independent neighboring nodes activate their respective transceivers to directly interact. Historically data exchange has always been initiated by the node willing to relay data i.e. the sender. However the Receiver-Initiated paradigm introduced by Lin et al. in 2004 with RICER and made popular by Sun et al. in 2008 with RI-MAC has spawned a whole new stream of research yielding tens of new MAC protocols. Within such paradigm the receiver is the one in charge of starting a direct communication with an eligible sender. This allows for new useful properties to be satisfied novel schemes to be introduced and new challenges to be tackled. In this paper we present a survey comprising of all the MAC protocols released since the year …
The internet of hackable things,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC,2016,The Internet of Things makes possible to connect each everyday object to the Internet making computing pervasive like never before. From a security and privacy perspective this tsunami of connectivity represents a disaster which makes each object remotely hackable. We claim that in order to tackle this issue we need to address a new challenge in security: education.
Mind the tracker you wear: a security analysis of wearable health trackers,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC,2016,Wearable tracking devices have gained widespread usage and popularity because of the valuable services they offer monitoring human's health parameters and in general assisting persons to take a better care of themselves. Nevertheless the security risks associated with such devices can represent a concern among consumers because of the sensitive information these devices deal with like sleeping patterns eating habits heart rate and so on. In this paper we analyse the key security and privacy features of two entry level health trackers from leading vendors (Jawbone and Fitbit) exploring possible attack vectors and vulnerabilities at several system levels. The results of the analysis show how these devices are vulnerable to several attacks (perpetrated with consumer-level devices equipped with just bluetooth and Wi-Fi) that can compromise users' data privacy and security and eventually call the tracker …
On the benefits and challenges of blockchains for managing food supply chains,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC,2021,The expansion of the food industry within and beyond national borders has resulted in complex collaborative networks and supply chains. The management culture adopted for food supply chains has an impact on the quality of the end product and the vitality of the businesses involved. In this report we focus on the use of blockchain technology and distributed ledgers in general for managing supply chains in the food and agricultural sectors. We explore the challenges with which typical management systems are faced such as food safety food fraud and inefficient processes as well as ethical aspects like fair trade animal welfare and the environmental impact of food production. The use of blockchain‐based systems for managing a supply chain offers significant benefits such as faster and more reliable traceability. Our analysis involving small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Denmark highlights that …
A survey on trust-based web service provision approaches,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,2010,The basic tenet of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is the possibility of building distributed applications on the Web by using Web Services as fundamental building blocks. The proliferation of such services is considered the second wave of evolution in the Internet age moving the Web from a collection of pages to a collections of services. Consensus is growing that this Web Service “revolution” won't eventuate until we resolve trust-related issues. Indeed the intrinsic openness of the SOC vision makes crucial to locate useful services and recognize them as trustworthy. In this paper we review the field of trust-based Web Service selection providing a structured classification of current approaches and highlighting the main limitations of each class and of the overall field. As a result we claim that a soft notion of trust lies behind such weaknesses and we advocate the need of a new approach based on a stronger …
ANTIBIoTIC 2.0: A fog-based anti-malware for Internet of Things,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,2019,The Internet of Things (IoT) has been one of the key disruptive technologies over the last few years with its promise of optimizing and automating current manual tasks and evolving existing services. However the increasing adoption of IoT devices both in industries and personal environments has exposed businesses and consumers to a number of security threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Along the way Fog computing was born. A novel paradigm that aims at bridging the gap between IoT and Cloud computing providing a number of benefits including security. In this paper we present ANTIBIOTIC 2.0 an anti-malware that relies upon Fog computing to secure IoT devices and to overcome the main issues of its predecessor (ANTIBIOTIC 1.0). In particular we discuss the design and implementation of the system including possible models for deployment security assumptions …
A self-protecting and self-healing framework for negotiating services and trust in autonomic communication systems,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,2009,In a federation of heterogeneous nodes that organize themselves the lack of a trusted third party does not allow establishing a priori trust relationships among strangers. Automated trust negotiation (TN) is a promising approach to establish sufficient trust among parties allowing them to access sensitive data and services in open environments. Although the literature on TN is growing two key issues have still to be addressed. The first one concerns a typical feature of real-life negotiations: we are usually willing to trade the disclosure of personal attributes in exchange for additional services and only in a particular order (according to our preferences). The second one concerns dependability. By their nature TN systems are used in unreliable contexts where it is important not only to protect negotiations against malicious attack (self-protection) but also against accidental failures (self-healing). In this paper we address …
Energy-efficient medium access control for energy harvesting communications,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=M9hLHUkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=M9hLHUkAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC,2015,While energy consumption is widely considered the primary challenge of wireless networked devices energy harvesting emerges as a promising way of powering the Internet of Things (IoT). In the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of the communication stack energy harvesting introduces spatial and temporal uncertainty in the availability of energy. In this context this paper focuses on the design and implementation of the MAC layer of wireless embedded systems that are powered by energy harvesting; providing novel protocol features and practical experiences to designers of consumer electronics who opt for tailoring their own protocol solutions instead of using the standards.
